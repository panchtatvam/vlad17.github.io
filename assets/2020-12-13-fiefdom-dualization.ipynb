    "# FIEFdom Dualization\n",
    "\n",
    "[AAA](http://aaa.princeton.edu/orf523) once taught me a generic dualization technique, which I remember with a mnemonic FIEFdom. Being able to take duals on the fly has been really useful in practical optimization scenarios for me, because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "* may provide computationally faster ways to solve primal problems.\n",
    "* provide certificates for lower bounds of optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last point in particular means for particularly nasty and spiky global optimization problems we can use random search and know when to stop, because if you're within $\\epsilon$ of a dual problem solution in objective value, you're at most that far away from your optimum in the primal.\n",

Right now our single-variable program is just the maximum of the set $S=\\{\\gamma: \\forall x\\,Ax=b,x\\ge 0\\implies \\gamma\\le c^\\top x\\}$. We'll come up with a predicate $\\exists\\lambda\\,\\exists\\mu\\ge 0\\,\\forall x\\,\\mathcal{L}(x, \\lambda, \\mu)=\\gamma$ that implies _the implication_ $\\forall x\\,Ax=b,x\\ge 0\\implies \\gamma\\le c^\\top x$.

Assuming the antecedent the left hand side of the equality $(*)$ simplifies to $x^\\top\\mu\\ge 0$ since both vectors are positive, proving the conclusion.
