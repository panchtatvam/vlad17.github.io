    "# Complex Hash Collisions\n",

    "This article investigates a fun thought experiment about the [Poisson-Binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_binomial_distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we're designing a large hash table. We know up-front we're going to get $n$ distinct keys, so let's number them $j\\in [n]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahead of time, we're allowed to see the set of hashes the $j$-th key will belong to. It is allowed to take on one of $c_j$ distinct hashes, $S_j=\\{h_1, \\cdots, h_{c_j}\\}\\subset\\mathbb{N}$, where at run time the real hash is sampled uniformly (and independently) from $S_j$ for each $j$. The only catch is these $S_j$ values could be really large, so maybe they're stored in a file or something, and we'd like to think about only reading them in a stream, as $m$ goes from $1$ to $n$, we get $S_m$, and hopefully we do some processing that takes constant memory with respect to $n$ and $\\left|S_m\\right|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get to choose the table size $T$, so the buckets key $j$ could belong in are now $S_j\\pmod{T}$ (with constituent hashes modded). A reasonable approach might be to look at an exponential table of primes $T$ and compute the expected number of collisions such a table would incur. If we could get this number of expected collisions, then we'd be able to make some space/time tradeoff to find our best $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, let's assume $h\\in S_j$ are all distinct modulo $T$. We'll revisit this later."

    "### The Poisson Binomial\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's fix $T$, and per our assumption let's pretend $ S_j\\pmod{T}\\subset[T]$ is of size $c_j$ after the modulo operation. By our assumption, each key $j$ can take on one of these hash values uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider the number $b_i$ of keys that fall into a particular bucket $i\\in[T]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b_i=\\sum_{j=1}^n1\\left\\{\\mathrm{hash}(j)=i\\right\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This $b_i$ is precisely distributed as a Poisson Binomial: each key $j$ falls in bucket $i$ with probability $c_j^{-1}$ independently among all $j$ such that $i\\in S_j\\pmod{T}$. Label this distribution $\\mathrm{PB}_i$ (note that its parameter is the full indexed set $\\left\\{c_j^{-1}\\,\\middle|\\, j\\in M_i\\right\\}$ where $M_i=\\left\\{j\\,\\middle|\\,i\\in S_j\\pmod{T}\\right\\}$).\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Easy Peasy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so fast. How would you actually compute the last probability, $\\mathbb{P}\\{\\mathrm{PB}_i=1\\}$? You'd need to compute the set $M_i$ entirely. There's something devious about the formula for probability of unity that isn't there in the probability of vanishing $\\prod_{j\\in M_i}(1-c_j^{-1})$. The latter is a commutative, associative reduction (a product) over the set $M_j$. So we can iterate through $m\\in[n]$ in a streaming manner, maintaining only one value per bucket ($T$ items total), which would be the running product $\\prod_{j\\in M_i,j\\le m}(1-c_j^{-1})$. When we process $S_m$, we just need to multiply each term in-place by $(1-c_m^{-1})$ for all $j\\in S_m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above works great for $\\mathbb{P}\\{\\mathrm{PB}_i=0\\}$, but what about $\\mathbb{P}\\{\\mathrm{PB}_i=1\\}$? For that, we need to compute $M_i$ for each $i\\in[T]$, requiring $\\sum_i\\left| M_i\\right|$ memory, which can be arbitrarily larger than $T$!\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do? One approach is to rely on approximations to the $\\mathrm{PB}_i$ distribution: Wikipedia links [Le Cam's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cam%27s_theorem). Even better approximations exist, courtesy of the [Chen-Stein bound](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325124?seq=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Really, give it a go, how would you compute the expression $\\mathbb{P}\\{\\mathrm{PB}_i=1\\}$ with only constant memory per bucket $i$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Exact Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a head start by looking at this SO [answer by user wolfies](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/78200/37308). In particular, it pulls in a concept called the probability generating function. The PGF $G_X$ of a non-negative, discrete random variable $X$ is $G_X(t)=\\mathbb{E}t^X$, which, by inspection of the resulting series, satisfies $\\mathbb{P}\\{X=k\\}=\\frac{G_X^{(k)}(0)}{k!}$, similar to the MGF, where $G_X^{(k)}$ is the $k$-th derivative of $G_X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For independent discrete random variables $X_1,\\cdots X_n$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_{\\sum_j X_j}(t)=\\prod_j G_{X_j}(t)\\,\\,.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\mathrm{PB}_i$ is the sum of $\\left|M_i\\right|$ independent Bernoulli random variables, and a Bernoulli-$p$ PGF is $1-p(1-t)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}(t)=\\prod_{j\\in M_i}(1-c_j^{-1}(1-t))\\,\\,.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The SO answer then goes on: all we need to do is expand the polynomial $G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}(t)$ above into its coefficient list, and then its $k$-th derivative at 0 divided by $k!$ is exactly the $k$-th term's coefficient, because the $k!$ term cancels out from the falling polynomial powers as you take derivatives!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is _extremely_ neat, and it certainly saves a bunch of computation time if we were looking for $\\mathbb{P}\\{\\mathrm{PB}_i=k\\}$, since a naive computation would require $\\binom{n}{k}$ terms, now reduced to expanding the $n$ coefficients, and what's more $G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}(t)$ is a product of terms, we can compute it by keeping a single coefficient list and updating its terms by processing $S_m$ in a streaming manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, each update would require $O(\\left|M_i\\right|)$ time, and we don't really get around our memory requirements. We're solving for $\\mathbb{P}\\{\\mathrm{PB}_i=1\\}$ in particular, does that give us anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, this is a _great_ jumping-off point. All we have to notice is that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{P}\\{\\mathrm{PB}_i=1\\}=G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}'(0)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we stream through $m\\in[n]$, we see $S_m$ and can imagine maintaining finite differences $\\prod_{j\\in M_i,j\\le m}(1-c_j^{-1}(1-t))\\bigg|_{t=\\pm h}$ for small $h$ for each bucket $i$. Each finite difference is updated for a new $j\\in S_m$ by multiplying a simple term $(1-c_j^{-1}(1-t))$ for one of $t\\in\\pm h$, and at the end we compute the quotient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, round-off error is brutal: we don't know $\\left|M_i\\right|$ ahead of time, and it can vary for different $i$, so we have different optimal $h$ for each $i$, and the error guarantees are different...\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, [complex-step differentiation](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S003614459631241X?journalCode=siread) has none of these problems. Since $G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}$ is analytic,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}'(t)=\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}(t+ ih)}{h}+O(h^2)\\,\\,.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can set $h=10^{-100}$ and then compute the complex product $G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}(t+ ih)$ incrementally, term-by-term, using 1 complex number of memory, and the divide by $h$ at the end without worry about numerical precision. This works out because $G_{\\mathrm{PB}_i}(t)$ is itself a product, and thus a commutative, associative reduction. This really comes in handy when the asymptotic approximations don't hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we can approach this from the coefficient list standpoint, too: if we only care about the first $k$ terms of $G_{\\mathrm{PB}}(t)$, then we need only to update that part of the coefficient list! We look at both approaches below."
