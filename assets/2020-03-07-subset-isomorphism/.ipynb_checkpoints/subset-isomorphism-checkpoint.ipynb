    "The focus of this post is to expand on an extremely useful, vectorizable isomorphism between indices, that comes up all the time: indexing pairs. In particular, it's often the case that we'd want to come up with an _a priori_ indexing scheme into a weighted, complete undirected graph on $V$ vertices and $E$ edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, our edge set is $\\binom{[V]}{2}=\\left\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), \\cdots, (V-3, V-2), (V-3, V-1), (V-2, V-1)\\right\\}$, the set of ordered $2$-tuples. Our index set is $\\left[\\binom{V}{2}\\right]=\\{0, 1, 2, \\cdots, V(V-1)/2 - 1\\}$ (note we're 0-indexing here).\n",

    "A natural question is why not just use a larger index. Say we're training a [GGNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05493), and we want to maintain embeddings for our edges. Our examples might be in a format where we have two vertices $(v_1, v_2)$ available. We'd like to index into an edge array maintaining the corresponding embedding. Here, you may very well get away with using an array of size $V^2$. That takes about twice as much memory as you need, though.\n",

    "A deeper problem is simply that you can _represent_ invalid indices, and if your program manipulates the indices themselves, this can cause bugs. This matters in settings like [GraphBLAS](http://graphblas.org/) where you're trying to vectorize classical graph algorithms.\n",

Since we're concerned about the values of `np.sqrt` for inputs at least 1, and on this domain the mathematical function is sublinear, there's actually _less_ rounding error in representing the square root of an integer with a double than the input itself. [Details here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22547057/1779853).\n",
