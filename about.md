Hello! I'm an EECS Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley.

I work at the RISELab. If you're an undergraduate (especially at Cal) interested in participating in research, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSde_4EVs913k0LlwyG9lu8GwHYfaYbsAiHfsqrdCQIQ1N16xA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and mention me in the Additional Information field.

If you find any typos or incorrect information, I would really appreciate it if you let me know! Please fill in a [GitHub issue form](https://github.com/vlad17/vlad17.github.io/issues/new).

If you want to contact me for some other reason, or don't have a GitHub account, then you can email me. It's my full first name (Vlad is short for Vladimir), followed by my last name (Feinberg) at Gmail.
