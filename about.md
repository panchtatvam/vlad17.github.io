Hello! I'm an EECS Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley.  

This website keeps track of things I blog about: for a list of all blog series, look at the [new-series label](/category/new-series).

I also eventually want it to replace my LinkedIn.

If you find any typos or incorrect information, I would really appreciate it if you let me know! Please fill in a [GitHub issue form](https://github.com/vlad17/vlad17.github.io/issues/new).

If you want to contact me for some other reason, or don't have a GitHub account, then you can email me. It's my full first name (Vlad is short for Vladimir), with my last name concatenated at gmail.
