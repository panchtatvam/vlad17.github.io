This website keeps track of things I blog about: for a list of all blog series, look at the [new-series label](/category/new-series).

I also eventually want it to replace my LinkedIn.

If you find any typos or incorrect information, I would really appreciate it if you let me know! Please fill in a [GitHub issue form](https://github.com/vlad17/vlad17.github.io/issues/new).

If you want to contact me for some other reason, or don't have a GitHub account, then you can email me. To prevent spam bots (the site code is available in a public repository in plaintext) from finding it, you'll have to guess what it is. I use Google mail, and my username is my full first name concatenated with my last. Note that Vlad is a nickname.

Blogs I follow:

* [Fast ML](http://fastml.com/)
* [Bartosz Milewski's Programming Cafe](https://bartoszmilewski.com/)
* [Machine Learning (Theory)](http://hunch.net/)
