# Nonconvex Second Order Methods

This is a high-level overview of the methods for second order local improvement optimization methods for non-convex, Lipschitz, (sub)differentiable, composite, and regularized functions with efficient derivatives, with a particular focus on neural networks (NNs).

Make sure to read the [general overview post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-19-neural-network-optimization-methods %}) first.
