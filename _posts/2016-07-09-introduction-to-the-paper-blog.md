# Paper Blog Series

This blog series is the main reason I've started my personal GitHub page. I intend to release some blog posts about research papers I'm reading. My intention here is to just catalog my notes, but I figured other people might find the summaries useful. Since I was going to keep my notes in Markdown anyway, Jekyll was not too difficult to set up.

## Topics

I anticipate these will change over time, but the following are the topics I'm intereted in:

* Machine Learning
* Optimization
* Distributed Systems
* Parallel Programming (in multi-core enviornments)
* Programming Languages

## Goals

Here are my intentions with these posts, ranked by importance.

1. To provide a self-contained and whole **summary** of the work: the posts should provide sufficient working knowledge of their work's key ideas, where "sufficient" means it should be clear what needs a deep-dive for a problem at hand.
2. To offer some open-ended talking points about the work: the posts should direct one with further insight to explore some related ideas.

As noted above, these posts should be a summary (they're meant to save us time from going back to the paper itself).

## Format

I'll maintain the paper's structure in the summary, corresponding to the Markdown heading hierarchy, up to three levels. Any further nested levelling is not from the paper itself but for clarity. That is, the first-tier header is my own delimiting; 2 corresponds to a section; 3, a subsection; 4, a subsubsection; and anything beyond is again my own).

For mathematical notation, I'll try my best to respect that used by the originating paper.
